This implementation is based on the FasterRCNN example of tensorpack

Installation instruction
You need to clone tensorpack: 
git clone https://github.com/ppwwyyxx/tensorpack /home/${USER}/vision/tensorpack/

To make sure, your tensorpack is compatible, better checkout the commit on which we base this implementation:
cd /home/${USER}/vision/tensorpack/
git checkout 6fdde15deac4f23eb31ffef9e8d405d9153a51cd

install some dependencies (using conda install / pip install / ...): 
termcolor,tqdm,tabulate,opencv-python,msgpack_numpy 
maybe a few more, maybe scipy, pillow
pycocotools (you can copy from /home/voigtlaender/vision/coco3, also need to add to PYTHONPATH)

Add tensorpack and pycocotools to your PTHONPATH: 
export PYTHONPATH=$PYTHONPATH:/home/${USER}/vision/tensorpack/:/home/${USER}/vision/coco3/PythonAPI/

Create a folder on your local disk on which models and logs will be stored and link it here under the name train_log:
mkdir -p /work/${USER}/data/tensorpack_models/
ln -s /work/${USER}/data/tensorpack_models/ train_log

Now you should be good to go!

The goal of our modifications is to produce class-agnostic proposals
